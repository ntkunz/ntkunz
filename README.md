# Welcome to Nicholas Kunz's GitHub 👋

![Profile Header](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33107555?v=4)

A place where I work on public personal projects and freelance project testing. Expect to see plenty of commits, many branches, and the oft push to main (as I am the sole worker on these projects at the moment). :computer:

## About Me

I'm Nicholas Kunz, a builder of things digital and tangible, including full-stack development. I love creating solutions that connect people, make their lives easier or more beautiful, and that make our world a better place.

## What I'm currently focused on

I'm currently in the process of giving Helping Neighbors a makeover:
- **Next.js:** Seeing as CRA is no longer optimal, I am currently migrating the project to Next.js in a new repository. 
- **REST API:** While functioning well, I desire a more effecient knowledge of relational database structures.
- **Usability:** Continuously improving the user experience.
- **Best Practices:** I am working on making my code more dry, my api calls more succinct, and my functionality more accessible.

I'm eager to learn and grow. If you have any suggestions or just want to chat about software engineering, analog photography, art gallery operating, skateboarding, machining, woodworking, or anything else, feel free to reach out!
