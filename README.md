### Welcome ðŸ‘‹


I am currently finishing my [Helping Neighbors](https://www.github.com/ntkunz/helping_neighbors) project, a full stack application to connect users based off of location with the objective of bartering skills and building communities. 

>It utilizes MySQL spatial relations and the Knex.js node package for safer querying. 

>Built with React, SASS, Axios, React-Router-Dom, Multer, and Express.
