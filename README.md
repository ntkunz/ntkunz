A place where experimentation meets code. Expect to see plenty of commits, adventures in new-to-me technologies, and the occasional main branch mishap! :computer:

## About Me

I'm Nicholas Kunz, and this GitHub space is where I bring my ideas to life. I'm passionate about full-stack development and creating solutions that connect people and make our world a better place.

**Description:** A full-stack application designed to bring neighbors closer by facilitating skill and time exchange. It's not only a project; it's my journey of learning and experimentation.

## What's Cooking

I'm currently in the process of giving Helping Neighbors a makeover:

- **Next.js:** Experimenting with this powerful React framework.
- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** Adding an extra layer of security.
- **Usability:** Continuously improving the user experience.
- **Best Practices:** Embracing clean coding and development standards.

I'm eager to learn and grow. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to chat about coding best practices, feel free to reach out!
