Currently finishing my Helping Neighbors project, a full stack application to connect users based off of location with the objective of bartering skills and building communities. 

>It utilizes MySQL spatial relations that utilizes the Knex.js node package for safer querying. 

>Built with React, SASS, Axios, React-Router-Dom, Multer, and Express.
