## About Me

I'm Nicholas Kunz, a builder of things digital and tangible, including full-stack web development. I love creating things that connect people, make their lives easier or more beautiful, and that make our world a better place. I also appreciate anything well made, from an app to a cabinet to a pillow.

## What I'm currently focused on

I'm eager to learn, grow, and have fun, particularly in the realm of JavaScript development and software engineering more broadly. If you have any ideas you'd like input on or just want to chat about coding, analog photography, art gallery operating, skateboarding, machining, woodworking, or anything else, I'd love to connect!
